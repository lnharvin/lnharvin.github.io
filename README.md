# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
Assist Roza with visualizing the bacterial data for each volunteer. Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
